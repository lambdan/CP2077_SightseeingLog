# Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored and can be used for comments etc.

# IDENTIFIER should be something uniquely identifiying this map, it's used for keeping track of what packages have been collected.
# So if you just add more points to a map, you should keep it the same. If you're making a whole new map, you should change it.
# If you want a user to have to collect all packages all over again you should switch it too.

# This maps identifier is packages1 because the original map included with 1.0 was called "packages1" and thus that was used as its internal identifier. 
# As this is just an evolution of that map (100 packages added) we keep the same identifier so that people who played with the 1.0 dont have to collect all packages all over again
IDENTIFIER:sslog1

# DISPLAY_NAME is what will be shown in the settings UI. It can be pretty.
DISPLAY_NAME:Default

# Now for the coordinates, they're in this format:
# X Y Z W (space separated)

# You can also put comments after the coordinate itself, just make sure to put a space after the final W coordinate
# W seems to always be 1 but better include it just to be safe...
# 2-3 decimals should be enough for XYZ
# These coordinates should be based on Player Position (Game.GetPlayer():GetWorldPosition(), also seen in the creation window)
# The prop used for the package will get a little boost in the Z axis to appear higher above the ground so you dont need to worry about that.
